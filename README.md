# Resturant-Voters

This is an application to vote for a resturant and based on voting select the menu.

You can switch to each checkpoint to see what the code looks like up to that point by either cloning the repo or using the GitHub branch menu.

## Cloning the repo
First clone this repo by running
```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/cuttarug/intro-to-flask.git
```

Then fetch each checkpoint to see what the code looks like at that point by running `$ git checkout [<checkpoint-name>]`. For example, to view the code at checkpoint "05\_contact\_form", type
```bash
$ git checkout 05_contact_form
```

## Using the GitHub branch menu
Alternatively, you can use GitHub's web interface to view each checkpoint. Click on the branch menu and select the checkpoint you want to view, shown below:
